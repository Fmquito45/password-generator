# Password-generator

## Description

Most of new accouts require a password to log in and sometimes we believe we dont make a strong enough password. With this project I was able to apply new skills and see them come to life. This is what motivated me, knowing I can build a project that can help orders generate a password to keep their accounts safe. Most times when one creates a password, it is based on themself or things aroud them. For example, birtday, city address, pet name, school name, favorite color. These examples could be easy to guess. Instead we want to apply a secure password that was generated online. In this project I was introduced to addEventListener and that is what allows use to generate the password once the button is clicked. The functions used to generate the code were set to run if they met certain conditions. We set an if() statement to make sure a valid character length was insert and made sure it was a number as well. Followed by a second if() statment to make sure at least one character group was selected. If statement was true it would generate a password to the indicated character length. What I learned here was how to randomly select from assigned variables holding down different character and input them into a new variable where our new password would be generated usung Math.floor(Math.random)

## Usage

To use this applicatoin click on "Generate Password". You'll be prompted to select a character length. If wrong length selected you'll be prompted to select between 8 & 128. Once character selected you'll be promted to select which character groups you'd like to include you new password. If selected at least one group, you get a text input of your new password generated.
